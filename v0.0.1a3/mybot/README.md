## Bottery Examples

This is a repository for creating example of [Bottery](http://bottery.io) 
projects.

This example uses the library [decouple](https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple/) to read the TOKEN from an .env file.

So you will need to create an .env file in the same directory of the settings.py file.

```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
```

Feel free to contribute!
